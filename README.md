# ðŸš€ DSA in Java - Striver A2Z & More  

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the **Striver A2Z DSA Course**, along with other important DSA questions I encounter. The solutions are implemented in **Java** and aim to provide clean, optimized code with clear explanations.  

### ðŸ”¹ What's Inside?  
- Solutions categorized by topics like **Arrays, Strings, Recursion, DP, Graphs, Trees, and more**.  
- Focus on **optimized approaches and best coding practices**.  
- Will expand beyond Striverâ€™s sheet to **Leetcode, Codeforces, and other problem sets** in the future.  

This serves as my **learning repository**, and if it helps others prepare for coding interviews, even better! ðŸš€  

### ðŸ“Œ Stay tuned for updates!
